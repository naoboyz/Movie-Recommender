When selecting your movie, make sure you include the release year after the name of the movie like this "Back to the Future (1985)" in first brackets. Don't worry I have listed all the release years in the "u.item" file. Just enter the movie you and year, enter how you're feeling and then boom!, you will get a recommended movie to watch according to your emotion.
